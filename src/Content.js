		Creating <b>dynamic</b> and <b>interactive data visualizations</b> on the web is a pain in the ass. It gets <i>really</i> hard when you add <b>animation</b>, inter-connected <b>dashboards</b>, and <b>fast performance</b> on mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're either using <b>libraries you can't customize</b>, <b>copy pasting D3 examples</b> you don't understand, or <b>battling documentation</b> to write spaghetti <b>code you can't reuse</b>.

        <SectionTitle>Learning a new coding paradigm is hard</SectionTitle>
        <WideLeftColumn>
            <p>
                <b>React is the biggest revolution</b> in JavaScript programming since jQuery hit the scene 10 years ago, and <b>D3 is unlike anything</b> you've seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"How the hell is it doing that?"</em> is the most common phrase I hear when teaching people about React and D3. <em>"What do I put in a component? Should it be a state or a prop? These D3 examples don't make any sense"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. <em>"It's like a cooking recipe"</em>, teachers will say.</p>
            <p>
                Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper, add olive oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple salad with a single ingredient, but it's a salad. You can follow along and eventually you will understand what the code does.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. <em>How</em> to do something.
            </p>
            <p>
                But React and D3 are declarative. <b>You don't write <em>How</em> you want your code to work, you write <em>What</em> you want to achieve</b>. Your bellpepper salad recipe looks more like this: <br />
                &lt;Salad&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Oil /&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Bellpepper cut salted /&gt;<br/>
                &lt;/Salad&gt;<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                You look at that and you immediately know it's a salad. It involves oil and bellpeppers. You don't have to read all the steps to know the result. <b>The recipe declares what it's making</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Declarative code makes your project <b>cleaner</b> and <b>easier to maintain</b>, which means you <b>spend more time delivering value to your users and clients</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <b>learning how to think declaratively</b> is hard. It feels like voodoo <b>magic until you get used to it</b>. We've all been there. To this day it still hurts my brain sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why <b>React+D3v4</b> takes you on a journey through <b>7 projects</b> and <b>5 interactive examples</b>. <b>Learn the basics in about an hour</b> then dive as deep as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get <b>the confidence you need to excell</b> at your job.

	    <p>
                Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Swizec Teller</b>. I help <b>coders become software engineers</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years I've helped over <b>10,000 engineers</b> hone their craft. People from Uber, Oracle, Apple and many others have used my <b>books, articles, and talks</b> to improve their technical skills, get promotions, change jobs, and ship their products faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Story time ðŸ‘‡
            </p>
            <p>
                React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted to learn React and challenged me to publish a book. A month later React+D3 launched with 79 pages of hard earned knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                In April 2016 it became React+D3 ES6. 117 pages and growing beyond a single big project it was a huge success. I kept going, started live streaming, and publishing videos on YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's 2017 now and after 10 months of work, <b>React+D3v4</b> is <b>the best book I've ever written</b>. 249 pages, many examples, much code to play with. It's designed like a step-by-step course so you can <b>follow along without breaking a sweat</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I based React+D3v4 on <b>20 years of experience</b> with learning how to code <b>on my own</b>, reading blogs and articles, listening to <b>professors</b>, and <b>working with mentors</b>. Yes, that means I wrote my <b>first program when I was 9</b>. I've been doing this all my life and that's why <b>I know every learning technique</b> inside and out.
            </p>

		    Is React+D3v4 for me?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    Yes. <br />
                    If you already know JavaScript and perhaps some React and D3, this book is perfect. It's designed with React and D3 beginners in mind. If you're a veteran, you might want to skip some sections.
                    But if you're new to web programming, I suggest finding something easier.

                <h2>
		    Which package should I choose?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    That depends on your preferred style of learning.<br />
                    The book is great if you like to learn the basics in your browser, then switch to a real editor and local environment to go deep.<br/>
                    The interactive course is great if you'd prefer to stay in your browser throughout.<br />
                    Coaching is perfect if you have specific questions or prefer explanations tailored to you personally.<br />
                    The videos are great, if you like to see how everything fits together visually.

            <h2>I don't like React. Is React+D3v4 still useful?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes! You can apply the core ideas behind React+D3v4 to any modern framework. Angular, Vue, or anything else that aims to separate business and rendering logic with a declarative approach.
