<p>Hi, I’m Swizec Teller. I help coders become software engineers. Over the
years I've helped over 10,000 engineers hone their craft. People from Uber,
Oracle, Apple and many others have used my books, articles, and talks to improve
their technical skills, get promotions, change jobs, and ship their products
faster. Story time 👇</p>

<p>React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted to learn React and
challenged me to publish a book. A month later React+D3 launched with 79 pages
of hard earned knowledge.</p>

<p>In April 2016 it became React+D3 ES6. 117 pages and growing beyond a single
big project it was a huge success. I kept going, started live streaming, and
publishing videos on YouTube.</p>

<p>It's 2017 now and after 10 months of work, React+D3v4 is the best book I've
ever written. 249 pages, many examples, much code to play with. It's designed
like a step-by-step course so you can follow along without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>I based React+D3v4 on 20 years of experience with learning how to code on my
own, reading blogs and articles, listening to professors, and working with
mentors. Yes, that means I wrote my first program when I was 9. I've been doing
this all my life and that's why I know every learning technique inside and
out.</p>
