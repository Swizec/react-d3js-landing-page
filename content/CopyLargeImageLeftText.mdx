**React is the biggest revolution** in JavaScript programming since jQuery hit
the scene 10 years ago, and **D3 is unlike anything** you've seen before. _"How
the hell is it doing that?"_ is the most common phrase I hear when teaching
people about React and D3. _"What do I put in a component? Should it be a state
or a prop? These D3 examples don't make any sense"_

The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. _"It's like a cooking
recipe",_ teachers will say.

Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper, add olive
oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple salad with a single
ingredient, but it's a salad. You can follow along and eventually you will
understand what the code does.

That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. _How_ to do
something.

But React and D3 are declarative. **You don't write How you want your code to
work, you write What you want to achieve.** Your bellpepper salad recipe looks
more like this:

You look at that and you immediately know it's a salad. It involves oil and
bellpeppers. You don't have to read all the steps to know the result. **The
recipe declares what it's making.**

Declarative code makes your project **cleaner** and **easier to maintain**,
which means you **spend more time delivering value to your users and clients.**

But **learning how to think declaratively** is hard. It feels like voodoo
**magic until you get used to it.** We've all been there. To this day it still
hurts my brain sometimes.

That's why **React+D3v4** takes you on a journey through **7 projects** and **5
interactive examples.** **Learn the basics in about an hour** then dive as deep
as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get **the confidence you need to
excell** at your job.
