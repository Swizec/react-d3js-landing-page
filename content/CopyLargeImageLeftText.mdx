React is the biggest revolution in JavaScript programming since jQuery hit the
scene 10 years ago, and D3 is unlike anything you've seen before. "How the hell
is it doing that?" is the most common phrase I hear when teaching people about
React and D3. "What do I put in a component? Should it be a state or a prop?
These D3 examples don't make any sense"

The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. "It's like a cooking
recipe", teachers will say. Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some
salt and pepper, add olive oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very
simple salad with a single ingredient, but it's a salad. You can follow along
and eventually you will understand what the code does.

That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. How to do
something. But React and D3 are declarative. You don't write How you want your
code to work, you write What you want to achieve. Your bellpepper salad recipe
looks more like this:

You look at that and you immediately know it's a salad. It involves oil and
bellpeppers. You don't have to read all the steps to know the result. The recipe
declares what it's making. Declarative code makes your project cleaner and
easier to maintain, which means you spend more time delivering value to your
users and clients. But learning how to think declaratively is hard. It feels
like voodoo magic until you get used to it. We've all been there. To this day it
still hurts my brain sometimes. That's why React+D3v4 takes you on a journey
through 7 projects and 5 interactive examples. Learn the basics in about an hour
then dive as deep as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get the confidence you
need to excell at your job.
