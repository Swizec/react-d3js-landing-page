Hi, Iâ€™m **Swizec Teller.** I help **coders become software engineers.**

Over the years I've helped over **10,000 engineers** hone their craft. People
from Uber, Oracle, Apple and many others have used my **books, articles, and
talks** to improve their technical skills, get promotions, change jobs, and ship
their products faster.

Story time ðŸ‘‡

React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted to learn React and
challenged me to publish a book. A month later React+D3 launched with 79 pages
of hard earned knowledge.

In April 2016 it became **React+D3** ES6. 117 pages and growing beyond a single
big project it was a huge success. I kept going, started live streaming, and
publishing videos on YouTube.

It's 2017 now and after 10 months of work, **React+D3v4** is **the best book**
I've ever written. 249 pages, many examples, much code to play with. It's
designed like a step-by-step course so you can **follow along without breaking a
sweat.**

I based React+D3v4 on **20 years of experience** with learning how to code **on
my own,** reading blogs and articles, listening to **professors**, and **working
with mentors.** Yes, that means I wrote my **first program when I was 9.** I've
been doing this all my life and that's why **I know every learning technique**
inside and out.

Some of my work has been featured in ðŸ‘‡
