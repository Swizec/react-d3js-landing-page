                Did you know software <b>engineers make $20,000/year more than programmers</b>? I had no idea a job title meant that much until I built some graphs and saw the difference. I never called myself a programmer again.

            <p>
		But creating <b>dynamic</b> and <b>interactive data visualizations</b> on the web is a pain in the ass. It gets <i>really</i> hard when you add <b>animation</b>, inter-connected <b>dashboards</b>, and <b>fast performance</b> on mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're either using <b>libraries you can't customize</b>, <b>copy pasting D3 examples</b> you don't understand, or <b>battling documentation</b> to write spaghetti <b>code you can't reuse</b>.

        <SectionTitle>Learning a new coding paradigm is hard</SectionTitle>
        <WideLeftColumn>
            <p>
                <b>React is the biggest revolution</b> in JavaScript programming since jQuery hit the scene 10 years ago, and <b>D3 is unlike anything</b> you've seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
	        If you're a seasoned veteran, or a fresh beginner, React and D3 can <b>leave you scratching your head</b>. You look at the code and you understand individual words and functions, everything makese sense on its own, but put it together and <b>it looks like magic</b>.
	    </p>
            <p>
                <em>"How the hell is it doing that?"</em> is the most common phrase I hear when teaching people about React and D3. <em>"What do I put in a component? Should it be a state or a prop? These D3 examples don't make any sense"</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. <em>"It's like a cooking recipe"</em>, teachers will say.</p>
            <p>
                Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper, add olive oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple salad with a single ingredient, but it's a salad. You can follow along and eventually you will understand what the code does.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. <em>How</em> to do something.
            </p>
            <p>
                But React and D3 are declarative. <b>You don't write <em>How</em> you want your code to work, you write <em>What</em> you want to achieve</b>. Your bellpepper salad recipe looks more like this: <br />
                &lt;Salad&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Oil /&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Bellpepper cut salted /&gt;<br/>
                &lt;/Salad&gt;<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                You look at that and you immediately know it's a salad. It involves oil and bellpeppers. You don't have to read all the steps to know the result. <b>The recipe declares what it's making</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Declarative code makes your project <b>cleaner</b> and <b>easier to maintain</b>, which means you <b>spend more time delivering value to your users and clients</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <b>learning how to think declaratively</b> is hard. It feels like voodoo <b>magic until you get used to it</b>. We've all been there. To this day it still hurts my brain sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why <b>React+D3v4</b> takes you on a journey through <b>7 projects</b> and <b>5 interactive examples</b>. <b>Learn the basics in about an hour</b> then dive as deep as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get <b>the confidence you need to excell</b> at your job.

		    Is React+d3.js for me?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    Yes. <br />If you already know JavaScript and you've tried d3.js before, this is the book for you. If you just want to learn about React, that's great too. Test readers said it's great for learning how to use React.<br />
                    But if you're new to web programming, I suggest finding something easier.

                <h2>
		    Which package should I choose?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    That depends on what you need. If you're a single developer trying to learn about React and writing reusable visualization components, go for the Engineer package. Some of the material looks better when it moves.<br/>
                    But if you have a team that's growing,  go for the Business package. I'll set up a call to help you apply these principles in your specific case. And you'll get a license that lets you share the book with all team members.
