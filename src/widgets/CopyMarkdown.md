# STUCK COPY PASTING RANDOM D3 EXAMPLES?

###**Become a data visualization engineer with** _React + D3v4_

Creating **dynamic** and **interactive data** visualizations on the web is a
pain in the ass. It gets really hard when you add **animation**, inter-connected
**dashboards**, and **fast performance** on mobile devices.

You're either using **libraries you can't customize**, copy pasting D3 examples
you don't understand, or **battling documentation** to write spaghetti **code
you can't reuse.**

It's okay, we've all been there.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

With **React+D3v4** you'll learn the basics of building **fast data
visualization components** in about an hour. Get started **immediately without
installing anything.**

Don't know React? **React+D3v4 starts at the very beginning.**

Struggling with D3? **Every function is explained.**

New to modern JavaScript syntax? React+D3v4 comes with an **interactive ES6
cheatsheet.**

Get the confidence you need to excell.ðŸ’ª

##LEARNING A NEW CODING PARADIGM IS HARD

**React is the biggest revolution** in JavaScript programming since jQuery hit
the scene 10 years ago, and **D3 is unlike anything** you've seen before. _"How
the hell is it doing that?"_ is the most common phrase I hear when teaching
people about React and D3. _"What do I put in a component? Should it be a state
or a prop? These D3 examples don't make any sense"_

The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. _"It's like a cooking
recipe",_ teachers will say.

Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper, add olive
oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple salad with a single
ingredient, but it's a salad. You can follow along and eventually you will
understand what the code does.

That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. _How_ to do
something.

But React and D3 are declarative. **You don't write How you want your code to
work, you write What you want to achieve.** Your bellpepper salad recipe looks
more like this:

You look at that and you immediately know it's a salad. It involves oil and
bellpeppers. You don't have to read all the steps to know the result. **The
recipe declares what it's making.**

Declarative code makes your project **cleaner** and **easier to maintain**,
which means you **spend more time delivering value to your users and clients.**

But **learning how to think declaratively** is hard. It feels like voodoo
**magic until you get used to it.** We've all been there. To this day it still
hurts my brain sometimes.

That's why **React+D3v4** takes you on a journey through **7 projects** and **5
interactive examples.** **Learn the basics in about an hour** then dive as deep
as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get **the confidence you need to
excell** at your job.

###BECOME A DATA VISUALIZATION ENGINEER WITH REACT+D3V4

React+D3v4 gives you a **quick overview of the basics** to get you started,
followed by a **deep dive** that **solidifies your knowledge** through varied
projects and examples. **Build working code** that you can **show off to your
friends, boss, and coworkers.**

Learn the basics with **interactive examples right in your browser** â€” no need
to install anything. Forget about Npm and Webpack and Babel and Node. **Just
React and D3.**

**Dive into 7 projects** that teach you how it all fits together. Build
**interactive visualizations,** create **animations,** and build **fast
performance with canvas.** Learn everything there is to know about building
**beautiful apps with React and D3.**

From the very **basics of React and D3**, to state handling with **Redux** and
**MobX**, React alternatives like **Preact** and **Inferno.**

---

###REACT+D3V4 GIVES YOU PRACTICAL EXAMPLES ðŸ‘‡

**An interactive choropleth map** shows you how to work with topographical data,
draw maps, and census regions. We implement zooming and map exploration.

**An interactive histogram** teaches you some of D3's statistical functions, and
the basics of drawing charts. Drawing shapes, adding axes, parsing data ...

Together they form an **interactive dashboard** where multiple charts share
data, react to common controls, and act together to give users a full picture.

**A rainbow snake** teaches you about building transition-based animation. We
place 50 circles on the screen and perform transitions when our user touches
them with their mouse.

**An animated alphabet** teaches you about creating enter/update/exit
transitions. Animate elements coming in and out of your data visualization.

**A particle generator** teaches you the basics of using **Redux** for state
management, pushing your browser to the limits, and animating tens of thousands
of elements.

**An interactive billiards game** teaches you about rendering graphical React
components onto HTML5 canvas, making them interactive, and using **MobX** for
state handling.

**A dancing pythagorean tree fractal** teaches you about component recursion. We
use it to compare differences between React, **Preact**, and **Inferno**.

##REUSABLE DATA VISUALIZATION WITH REACT AND D3.JS

####Watch my talks from HTML5DevConf and the Bay Area D3 Meetup The talk shows a
proof of concept approach to making fancy animations with React and d3js - a
Space Invaders game. I explain the basic approach, where I got the idea, and
show off some code.

You don't have to watch the whole talk, it's all in React+D3v4.

This talk is more hands on. I show how the animated alphabet, particle
generator, and talk about the benefits of componentization when it comes to
building modern data visualization.

###ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Hi, Iâ€™m **Swizec Teller.** I help **coders become software engineers.**

Over the years I've helped over **10,000 engineers** hone their craft. People
from Uber, Oracle, Apple and many others have used my **books, articles, and
talks** to improve their technical skills, get promotions, change jobs, and ship
their products faster.

Story time ðŸ‘‡

React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted to learn React and
challenged me to publish a book. A month later React+D3 launched with 79 pages
of hard earned knowledge.

In April 2016 it became **React+D3** ES6. 117 pages and growing beyond a single
big project it was a huge success. I kept going, started live streaming, and
publishing videos on YouTube.

It's 2017 now and after 10 months of work, **React+D3v4** is **the best book**
I've ever written. 249 pages, many examples, much code to play with. It's
designed like a step-by-step course so you can **follow along without breaking a
sweat.**

I based React+D3v4 on **20 years of experience** with learning how to code **on
my own,** reading blogs and articles, listening to **professors**, and **working
with mentors.** Yes, that means I wrote my **first program when I was 9.** I've
been doing this all my life and that's why **I know every learning technique**
inside and out.

Some of my work has been featured in ðŸ‘‡

###IS REACT+D3V4 FOR ME?

Yes. If you already know JavaScript and perhaps some React and D3, this book is
perfect. It's designed with React and D3 beginners in mind. If you're a veteran,
you might want to skip some sections. But if you're new to web programming, I
suggest finding something easier.

###WHICH PACKAGE SHOULD I CHOOSE?

That depends on your preferred style of learning. The book is great if you like
to learn the basics in your browser, then switch to a real editor and local
environment to go deep. The interactive course is great if you'd prefer to stay
in your browser throughout. Coaching is perfect if you have specific questions
or prefer explanations tailored to you personally. The videos are great, if you
like to see how everything fits together visually.

###I DON'T LIKE REACT. IS REACT+D3V4 STILL USEFUL?

Yes! You can apply the core ideas behind React+D3v4 to any modern framework.
Angular, Vue, or anything else that aims to separate business and rendering
logic with a declarative approach.

###WHAT IF I HATE REACT+D3V4?

Send me an email and I'll click the magic refund button. You even get to keep
the book.

###I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION!

Awesome! Just ping me on twitter or send me an email. I'm @swizec.
