                Did you know software <b>engineers make $20,000/year more than programmers</b>? I had no idea a simple job title meant that much until I built some graphs and saw the difference. I never called myself a programmer again.

		But creating <b>dynamic</b> and <b>interactive data visualizations</b> on the web is a pain in the ass. It gets <i>really</i> hard when you add <b>animation</b>, inter-connected <b>dashboards</b>, and <b>fast performance</b> on mobile devices.

        <WideLeftColumn>
            <p>
                <b>React is the biggest revolution</b> in JavaScript programming since jQuery came on the scene 10 years ago, and <b>D3 is unlike anything</b> you've ever seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
	        If you're a seasoned veteran, or a fresh beginner, React and D3 can <b>leave you scratching your head</b>. You look at the code and you understand the individual words and functions, and stuff makes sense on its own, but you put them together and <b>it looks like magic</b>.
	    </p>
            <p>
                <em>"How the hell is it doing that?"</em> is the most common phrase I hear when teaching people about React and D3.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, the problem comes from how we all start writing code. <em>"It's like a cooking recipe"</em>, teachers will say.</p>
            <p>
                Take a bellpepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper, add olive oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple salad with a single ingredient, but a salad nontheless.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's called imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. <em>How</em> to do something.
            </p>
            <p>
                React and D3, on the other hand, are declarative. <b>You don't write <em>How</em> you want your code to work, you write <em>What</em> you want to achieve</b>. Your bellpepper salad recipe looks more like this: <br />
                &lt;Salad&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Oil /&gt;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Bellpepper cut salted /&gt;<br/>
                &lt;/Salad&gt;<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
               You look at that and you immediately know you're going to get a salad that includes oil and bellpeppers. No need to carefully study the entire recipe to understand what you're making. The recipe <i>declares</i> what it's making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Declarative code makes your project <b>cleaner</b> and <b>easier to maintain</b>, which means you <b>spend more time delivering value to your users and clients</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <b>learning how to think declaratively</b> is hard. It feels like voodoo magic until you get used to it. Believe me, we've all been there. It still hurts my brain sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why <b>React+D3v4</b> takes you on a journey through <b>7 projects</b> and <b>5 interactive examples</b>. <b>Learn the basics in about an hour</b> then dive as deep as you want to solidify your knowledge. Get <b>the confidence you need to excell</b> at your job.

	    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m <span itemProp="name">Swizec Teller</span>. A digital nomad and full stack web engineer.</p>
            <p>I travel the world and help startups win. From setting up new teams and training juniors, to fixing spaghetti code and implementing new features.</p>
            <p>My code has been used by MasterCard, Commerzbank, Google, Mashable, Lyft, and many others.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m writing.</p>
            <p>At least 5000 people bought my books ... I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a lot, but itâ€™s more than zero. I like that.</p>
            <p>My work has been featured in Business Insider, LifeHacker, Huffington Post, and several dead-tree magazines. Iâ€™ve spoken on BBC Radio, appeared on Slovenian national television, and given talks all over the world.</p>

		    Is React+d3.js for me?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    Yes. <br />If you already know JavaScript and you've tried d3.js before, this is the book for you. If you just want to learn about React, that's great too. Test readers said it's great for learning how to use React.<br />
                    But if you're new to web programming, I suggest finding something easier.

                <h2>
		    Which package should I choose?
		</h2>
		<p>
		    That depends on what you need. If you're a single developer trying to learn about React and writing reusable visualization components, go for the Engineer package. Some of the material looks better when it moves.<br/>
                    But if you have a team that's growing,  go for the Business package. I'll set up a call to help you apply these principles in your specific case. And you'll get a license that lets you share the book with all team members.
