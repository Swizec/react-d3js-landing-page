Creating **dynamic** and **interactive data** visualizations on the web is a
pain in the ass. It gets really hard when you add **animation**, inter-connected
**dashboards**, and **fast performance** on mobile devices.

You're either using **libraries you can't customize**, copy pasting D3 examples
you don't understand, or **battling documentation** to write spaghetti **code
you can't reuse.**

It's okay, we've all been there.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

With **React+D3v4** you'll learn the basics of building **fast data
visualization components** in about an hour. Get started **immediately without
installing anything.**

Don't know React? **React+D3v4 starts at the very beginning.**

Struggling with D3? **Every function is explained.**

New to modern JavaScript syntax? React+D3v4 comes with an **interactive ES6
cheatsheet.**

Get the confidence you need to excell.💪
