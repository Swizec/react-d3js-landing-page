question='IS REACT+D3V4 FOR ME?'
answer="Yes. 
If you already know JavaScript and perhaps some React and D3, this book is perfect. It's designed with React and D3 beginners in mind. If you're a veteran, you might want to skip some sections. But if you're new to web programming, I suggest finding something easier."
